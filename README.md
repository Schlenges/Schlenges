### Hi there! 🍃

I'm Meike, a web and software developer from Germany 🇩🇪  

Mainly focused on JavaScript at the moment, I very much enjoy backend development with Node.js and am in the midst of expanding my skills with React. I'm also learning Python and already love the language, so I'm eager to work a lot more with it in the future as well.

Currently I am also **looking for a new position**. Remote job opportunities would be highly welcomed 🙂

Here are some of my favourite projects I've been working on so far:
----------

  <summary><a href="https://github.com/Schlenges/DB-Heatmap-Analyser">Heatmap Analyser</a></summary>
  This was a project I created for Deutsche Bahn, a German railway company, as part of my time at a local consulting company. The program is being used in their testing process. It downloads heatmap files from a server and compares them on specific criteria, outputting the relevant differences for further analysis.

  <summary><a href="https://github.com/Schlenges/Taifun-PDF-Autofiller">Custom PDF Autofiller</a></summary>
  A program that can be used to autofill pdf's with csv data from TAIFUN, a software for craft businesses. It uses a third party package to convert the pdf to html and then modifies it accordingly.

  <summary><a href="https://github.com/Schlenges/doctor-who-quote-api">Doctor Who Quotes API</a></summary>
  A simple but fun API serving a few quotes from the TV show Doctor Who.

  An ongoing collection of small Python projects for practice.

I've also been working on a project that is supposed to hopefully turn into a full-fledged open source application and serve as the foundation to an educational series. I'm planning on getting parts of it set up in time for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to provide beginner-friendly access to issues and open source contribution. In the long-run I'd also like to turn it into a series of project-based learning resources teaching different languages and frameworks. It's still in the beginning phases and lacking proper documentation, but the repositories can be found here: https://github.com/lvlup-app
